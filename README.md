# ANZ GoMoney API v5.0

It's been about 2 years and the previous version of this document must be out of date. There has been 3 more versions of the API as it currently appears to be Version 5.

I'm slowly making a Swift API framework to help myself learn Swift 2.0 (and maybe write some tests!) with the aim to make a watch app that can show my balances and allow me to transfer "fast cash" from one account to another at the touch of a button. ‚åöÔ∏èüí∏

This is all accessable by anyone by simply proxying your device through something like Charles Proxy.

I found it interesting that the app adds `rooted` to the user-agent header if you're on a jailbroken device, and even warns you on the device. I didn't need to jailbreak to find this information out.

Everything seems to be `Content-Type: application/json`

## Base URL

`https://secure.anz.co.nz/api/v5`

Then every request is split between `/u` and `/s`.
Sessions get managed with `/u` and data is pulled from `/s`.

So I don't know what they stand for? (User/Service maybe)

## Authentication

Each client application has it's own API key as far as I can tell. This will most likely be hard coded into the app (or generated first launch, and stored in the keychain as it seems to be constant through re-installs - must check on Android)

API Key for the iOS Client: `9b415be2-1a04-493c-b0e7-7895c6242698`

API Key for the Android Client: `?`

This API Key is included in every HTTP request to the server in the header fields as `Api-Key`.

When we make a call to `/u/session` we get sent a cookie that we must set.

I haven't checked if the API requires a known user agent but the app uses `goMoney NZ/4.6.0/Wifi/iPhone7,2/9.0/`

## Headers

	Api-Key: 9b415be2-1a04-493c-b0e7-7895c6242698
	Request-Tag: PwGuest
	Content-Type: application/json
	User-Agent: goMoney NZ/4.6.0/Wifi/iPhone7,2/9.0/
	Api-Request-Id: AEF5A3FA-35CA-451B-A995-B26F8EF95954

Api-Request-Id appears to be a random UUID generated by the clients for logging I presume.

## Error Handling

Let's figure out how errors appear to be handled.

Sometimes we simply get a code back

	{
		"code": "E884125"
	}

Usually we get a structured response

	{
		"code": "loginDenied",
		"devDescription": "The user cannot log in - e.g. credentials were incorrect, account is locked, etc",
		"sinceVersion": 5,
		"httpStatus": 401,
		"serverDateTime": "2015-08-28T13:40:31.910+1200",
		"suppressed": []
	}

And sometimes we get the same result as above but with some data to be used in the 'next step'

	{
		"code": "authCodeSent",
		"devDescription": "The Auth Code has been sent to the client, please send the request with this code.",
		"sinceVersion": 5,
		"httpStatus": 400,
		"errorParameters": {
			"oneTimePassword": "gauP8S4w9FiF/f1aIjxdJhkclixAdR",
			"maskedMobilePhoneNumber": "******1234"
		},
		"serverDateTime": "2015-08-28T13:45:59.533+1200"
	}

### Error Codes

I've started to compile a list of error codes

| Error Code | Status Code | Dev Description |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
| loginDenied | 401 | The user cannot log in - e.g. credentials were incorrect, account is locked, etc |
| authCodeSent | 400 | The Auth Code has been sent to the client, please send the request with this code. |
| E884125 | 403 | null |
| tooManySessions | 403 | The user already has more than the maximum allowed number of sessions |
| E111898 | 401 | null |


## Calls
### Login using userId and password
Pretty simple. Use your online banking userid and password.

	POST /u/sessions
	{
		"userId": "12345678",
		"password": "password"
	}

If you have setup OnlineCode then you will get a 400 json respose as follows

	{
		"code": "authCodeSent",
		"devDescription": "The Auth Code has been sent to the client, please send the request with this code.",
		"sinceVersion": 5,
		"httpStatus": 400,
		"errorParameters": {
			"oneTimePassword": "gauP8S4w9FiF/f1aIjxdJhkclixAdR",
			"maskedMobilePhoneNumber": "******1234"
		},
		"serverDateTime": "2015-08-24T18:07:43.794+1200"
	}

Which you then make another request to the same endpoint like so

	POST /u/sessions
	{
		"oneTimePassword": "gauP8S4w9FiF/f1aIjxdJhkclixAdR"
		"userId": "12345678",
		"authCode": "1234"
	}

The server will return a json object like so

	{
		"httpStatus": 200,
		"serverDateTime": "2015-08-24T18:07:57.207+1200",

	}

Lot's of things!

So this call gets you some information about the user but we can't make calls yet as we need to setup a device pin, which is all done serverside.

### Login using pin and deviceToken
Once we have a `deviceToken	` and have setup our `pin` we can use these to login.
Similar to the first call just call

	POST /u/sessions
	{
		"deviceToken": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
		"pin": "xxxx"
	}

The server will return the same response as the first login.

I am not 100% sure where the device token comes from.

### Verify Pin
To verify a pin number, or set one up to get a device token make the following call

	POST /s/pins/verify
	{
		"pin": "xxxx",
		"newDevice": {
			"description": "[iPhone6,1]"
		}
	}

The server will respond with

	200
	{
		"newDevice": {
			"key": "xxxxxxxx",
			"deviceToken": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
		},
		"httpStatus": 200,
		"serverDateTime": "2013-12-23T22:53:46.830+1300"
	}

Now we have set the `pin` and we have the `deviceToken`. We can authenticate without our username and password now!

### Accounts
List all the accounts of the user

	GET /s/accounts

The server will respond with a JSON object containing the serverTime, httpStatus, invalidTransfers and an Array of Account objects

	200
	{
		"serverDateTime": "",
		"httpStatus": 200,
		"invalidTransfers": [],
		"accounts": [{
			"key": "xxxxxxxx",
			"customerKey": "xxxxxxxx",
			"accountNumber": "xx-xxxx-xxxxxxx-xx",
			"productName": String,
			"nickname": String,
			"balance": "0.00",
			"available": "0.00",
			"ownerName": "MR xxxxxxxx",
			"transferSource": true,
			"transferDest": true,
			"p2mSource": true,
			"p2mDest": true,
			"allowPayments": true,
			"hashedAccountNumber": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
			"overdraftLimit": "0.00",
			"p2mAccount": true,
			"ableToPayUnsavedPayee": true,
			"type": "current",
			"pieAccount": false,
			"hasTransactionHistory": true,
			"cashAdvanceAccount": false
		}]
	}
